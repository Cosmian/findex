### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

## [7.0.0] - 2025-02-03

### üöÄ Features

Refactoring to follow the eponymous paper published on e-print:

- drop the need for the additional label
- use AES-XTS for encryption instead of AES-GCM;
- use a memory abstraction to allow for different back-end implementation
  (present release proposes an in-memory and a Redis version);
- use an encoder abstraction to allow for different data-serialization
  strategies (present release propose a generic encoder that suits variable-,
  average-length values);

## [6.0.0] - 2023-11-21

### Features

Findex v6 implements new look following the work on the Findex formalization with @chloehebant.

In order to ease the reading, fix some vocabulary first:

- Encrypted Dictionary (EDX): a key value store which values are of constant size;
- Encrypted Multi-Map (EMM): a key value store which values are of variable size;
- Encrypted Graph (EGX): an encrypted graph which nodes contain data and pointers to other nodes;
- Encrypted Dictionary Scheme (DX-Enc): a scheme managing an EDX;
- Encrypted Multi-Map Scheme (MM-Enc): a scheme managing an EMM;
- Encrypted Graph Scheme (GX-Enc): a scheme managing an EGX;
- tag: bytes (may be a meaningful piece of information) used to point to a value in an map (H(w) in the Entry Table)
- token: _non-meaningful_ bytes used to index a value in a map (it corresponds to the UIDs)

Findex (as the product) is now composed of three algorithms:

- Findex: an index interface to hide the cryptographic details of Findex Graph;
- Findex Graph: a GX-Enc scheme using a MM-Enc scheme;
- Findex Multi-Map: a MM-Enc scheme using two DX-Enc schemes.

Two generic DX-Enc schemes are used by Findex Multi-Map:

- Entry Table: an EDX scheme in charge of storing metadata about the chains: counter, key seed (Kwi), corresponding tag (H(w_i));
- Chain Table: an EMM used to store the actual chain data; it's implementation is actually done using an EDX.

**HAS BEEN DONE**:

- [x] decide which constant to fix and which constant to use as generic (e.g. `BLOCK_LENGTH`/`LINE_LENGTH`)
- [x] add compact operation
- [x] pass all old tests
- [x] pass regression tests on database:
  - [x] add regression tests inside the repo (serialize in-memory database)
  - [x] change counter back to the hash chain
- [x] make findex types `Sync + Send`
- [x] add encryption scheme to manage encryption
- [x] update CryptoCore version
- [x] add `progress` callback (injection)
- [x] add CATS compatibility
